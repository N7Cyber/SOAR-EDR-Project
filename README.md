# SOAR-EDR-Project

## Objective

The goal of this SOAR EDR project was to simulate the creation of a playbook to efficiently automate the detection and response to threats. Providing hands on experience with Tines & LimaCharlie in a controlled environment.

### Skills Learned

- Ability to create detection rules based on system logs.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting system logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Experience creating automated workflows.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Experience creating & implementing playbooks.

### Tools Used

- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) for advanced endpoint monitoring, detection and response (LimaCharlie).
- Tines for workflow automation.
- Cloud hosted virtual machine for controlled environment.
- Slack & email integration for versatile threat detection and response notification.
